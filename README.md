# House Price Predictor with Kelvin 

This is a simple machine learning project built during Week 1 of my 12-Week Tech Challenge.

The goal was to understand how Python, Jupyter Notebooks, and basic ML algorithms come together to solve real-world problems — in this case, predicting housing prices using features like number of bedrooms and square footage.

## What It Does

- Loads a small sample dataset of houses
- Trains a **Linear Regression** model using `scikit-learn`
- Predicts home prices based on input features
- Allows you to test custom input (e.g. 3 bedrooms, 1700 sqft)

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook (via VS Code)
- Pandas
- scikit-learn

## How to Run It

1. Clone the repo
2. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn
3. Open the .ipynb notebook or run the .py script in your editor
4. Run each cell to train the model and make predictions

## Why I Built This
As part of my personal upskilling journey, I'm learning how machine learning works from the ground up. This project helped connect the dots between Python syntax and real AI tools. This was also built with the help of co-pilot to correct a plethora of errors I made in the syntax. 

## One Rep at a Time
Just like basketball… reps build skill, and skill wins games.
